                Hey everyone, Kamen here. I'm an upcoming Content Creator & Software Engineer with a burning desire to realize my full potential. I believe in leaving the woodpile higher than I found it and I'm keen on learning new things wherever the opportunity presents itself. Additionally, I'm in love with Japan and as such, I'm currently learning Japanese, albeit through self-study, I'm not averse to studying with others and making new connections along the way. As no matter the subject, I believe we all stand to gain more by assisting each other than treading alone.
                </p>
